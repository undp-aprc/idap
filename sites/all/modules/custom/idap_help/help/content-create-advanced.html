<h3>Create a content summary</h3>
<p>At various places throughout the site – especially in blocks that appear on the home page and other landing pages – a summary of content is displayed. Normally, this summary is generated automatically using the first couple of sentences of the body text from a piece of content. Sometimes, however, it is better to specify the summary text that will be displayed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Above the 'body' text field, click the 'Edit Summary' link.</li>
<li>A new box will appear, titled 'Summary'.</li>
<li>Enter the text you would like to appear wherever a content summary is displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some additional, advanced options, that you can set when you create a piece of content, though in most cases you can ignore these advanced settings.</p>
<h3>Revision Information</h3>
<p>When you update content, rather than overwriting the existing version that is stored in the database, you can create a 'revision'. Later, you can choose to revert your content to an earlier revision if you need to.</p>
<h3>URL Path Settings</h3>
<p>You can give your content a 'friendly' path, such as 'about' for a page about the site. Users can then access the content using the friendly URL, such as <em>http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/about</em> rather than the less intuitive default path like <em>http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/node/342</em>. To set a custom path, type it in the 'URL alias' box. For the path above, for example, type 'about' in the URL alias box.</p>
<h3>Comment Settings</h3>
<p>You can choose whether other users can write comments on your content by specifying whether comments are 'open' (accepting comments) or 'closed' (not accepting comments).</p>
<h3>Authoring Information</h3>
<p>By default the content will be stored with the current user's own user ID as the author. You can, however, assign the content to a different user by typing their username in the 'Authored By' box. Similarly, you can override the default published date by entering another date in the 'Authored On' box.</p>
<h3>Publishing Options</h3>
<p>You can save content, but set it to 'unpublished' so it is not publicly accessible. Please note, however, that this may not be entirely secure and is not to be used for sensitive or confidential content you want to hide. The other options 'Promoted to front page' and Sticky at top of lists' are not currently supported in inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net.</p>
<p>You may prevent a piece of published content from sending notifications to subscribed users by unchecking the ' Send subscriptions notifications' box.</p>
