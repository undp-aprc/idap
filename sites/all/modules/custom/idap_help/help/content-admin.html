	<li>Navigate to the content administration page at <a href="http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/admin/content" target="_blank">http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/admin/content</a></li>
	<li>You may use the controls in the 'show only content where' box to filter the list of content displayed by type and/or status. You can, for example, choose to display only content of type 'E-Discussion', only content that is 'published' or only content that is of type 'E-Discussion' and also published.</li>
	<li>In the content listing, each item has a checkbox to the left of the title. You can tick one or more checkboxes to select content upon which you wish to perform an operation.</li>
	<li>In the '<em>Update Options</em>' box, you can choose an operation from the select list. When you click '<em>update</em>' it will perform whichever operation you choose on each of the items of content you have checked below.  If for example, you have checked three items, then choose '<em>Delete Selected Content</em>' from the operations list, then click '<em>Update</em>', it will delete the checked items (it will prompt you to confirm first!).</li>
