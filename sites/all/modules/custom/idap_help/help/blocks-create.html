	<li>Navigate to <a href="http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/block/add">http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/block/add</a> (this page is accessible from the '<em>Create Block</em>' link in administration toolbar at the top of the page).</li>
	<li>Click the type of block (block type) you would like to create.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>An 'Editorial Listing' type block (eg. Editorial Listing with Photo) allows you to choose a particular piece of content you would like to display in the block. Editorial listing blocks are recommended when you wish to highlight a particular piece of content, such as a specific publication or report.</li>
		<li>An 'Item Listing' type block (eg. Item listing with photo) allows you to display an automatic list of content, which is ordered by date (most recent content first). Item listings are recommended when you want to automatically display new content in a block, such as a list of recent news articles.</li>
		<li>An 'HTML Block' allows you to create a block of custom content.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Fill in the form to create your new block</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The 'Label' is the name of the block that will appear in the list of blocks you can place on a page. Enter a name that provides a clear description of the block (such as how many items it lists, and what type of content it displays) as this will make it easy to place your block later.</li>
		<li>Always select 'Default' for the View Mode.</li>
		<li>The 'Title' is the text that will be displayed to users at the top of the block (Eg. 'MDG News', 'Recent Publications').</li>
		<li>The 'Node View Mode' sets the format of content that will be displayed. 'Photo Teaser', for example, displays content as a list of content with a title, a small text summary and a photo (if the content has a photo field).</li>
		<li>'Records shown' sets the maximum number of items that will be displayed in a block.</li>
		<li>The 'more link' can be used to set a link to a custom URL. Enter the text that should be displayed on the link (such as 'View All') and the URL that will open when clicked.</li>
		<li>The content filter is used to choose the type of content that will be displayed in the block. Choosing 'Network News', for example, ensures that only 'Network News' is displayed in the block.</li>
		<li>Click '<em>Save</em>' to store the new block.</li>
