<p>When a user creates content, by default the content is 'unpublished'. While content is unpublished it is not displayed in blocks and can only be accessed by site administrators.</p>
<p>Within the content moderation workflow it is set to a 'draft' state. While in a draft state, the content is queued so the Content Manager can review and either approve or delete the content.</p>
<p>After reviewing a piece of content, a Content Manager can change its state from 'draft' to 'final', which publishes the content. Once published, the content becomes visible throughout the site (except for private Collaboration Space content, which is still only visible to Collaboration Space members).</p>
