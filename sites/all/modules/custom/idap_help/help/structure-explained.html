<p>Inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net is organised around a set of <b>pillars</b>. These pillars represent the most abstract level of development practice and discourse such as 'inclusive growth', 'inequalities and social policies' and 'green growth'.</p>
<p>These pillars are used to group related <b>development themes</b>. 'Social Protection', 'Inclusive Growth' and 'Inequalities' are, for example, grouped under the 'Inequalities and Social Policies' pillar.</p>
<p>Each development theme has a <b>home page</b> and may have one or more <b>sub-pages</b> that automatically -- or in some cases manually -- display summaries of information drawn from the theme's content.</p>
<p>These summaries are displayed in '<b>blocks</b>'. Blocks are the smallest unit of information in the site, which are embedded inside pages, and may be used to display automatically generated lists of content.</p>
<p>Finally, <b>content</b> are various types of items (such as news articles, blog articles, events or resources) that are stored in the site. Content consists of a title and one or more custom fields that can capture different types of data such as text, dates, images or files or taxonomy terms.</p>
<p>The site structure is depicted in Figure 1 below.</p>
