<p>The 'Workbench' is the tool the site Administrator uses to arrange the overall structure of inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net including the development themes, and home and sub-pages for the development themes. The Workbench automates many tasks such as inserting links to the development themes into the main menu, setting up the development theme banners, sub-menus and the home page carousel.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to <a href="http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/admin/structure/workbench" target="_blank">http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net/admin/structure/workbench</a></li>
	<li>The 'Sections Overview' lists details of all the Development Themes that currently exist in the site.</li>
	<li>To add a new Development Theme to the site, click '<em>Create a new section</em>'.</li>
	<li>Give your section a title. This title will be displayed in the main menu, on the carousel and some other places so it is recommended to keep it as concise as possible.</li>
	<li>Choose the pillar that this development theme belongs to. Remember this controls the position of the development theme in the menu.</li>
	<li>Upload a banner image. This is the image that is displayed at the top of the Development Theme home page and sub-pages. This image should be 983 pixels wide by 150 pixels high. If you use an image of different dimensions, it will be automatically cropped to 983px x 150px and may give unexpected results.</li>
	<li>Provide some 'Carousel Text'. This text is displayed on the home page carousel. The text should be short and concise (50 words or less).</li>
	<li>Upload a carousel image. This image is displayed on the home page carousel alongside the text you specify. This image should be 380 pixels wide by 250 pixels high. If you use an image of different dimensions, it will be automatically cropped to 380px x 250px and may give unexpected results.</li>
	<li>Click '<em>Create Section</em>' to create your new Development Theme section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have created a section, it will now appear on the 'Sections Overview' list. To make the section active, however, you still need to create some pages that people will view when they visit the Development Theme section.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click the '<em>Manage Pages</em>' link to the right of your new development theme.
	<li>Create a home page by clicking 'Add a section home page'.</li>
	<li>Give your new home page a title.  It is recommended to give your page a title similar to that of your Development Theme rather than a generic title like 'home'.</li>
	<li>Choose a page template by clicking on one of the page template options available. This determines the overall layout of your page when you place blocks.</li>
	<li>Click '<em>Create Page</em>'.</li>
	<li>Create a subpage by clicking '<em>Add a subpage</em>'.</li>
	<li>Give your subpage a title. You can use a generic title for subpages like 'news' or 'blogs'.</li>
	<li>Choose a page template by clicking on one of the page template options available. This determines the overall layout of your page when you place blocks.</li>
	<li>Click '<em>Create Page</em>'.</li>
	<li>You may create more than one subpage by repeating steps 6 â€“ 9.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can now test your Development Theme section by returning the home page (<a href="http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net" target="_blank">http://www.inclusivedevelopmentasiapacific.net</a>), locate and click on the pillar in which you saved your Development Theme section, then locate and click on the link to your Development Theme section. Confirm your section has the correct banner and submenu links between the banner image.</p>

<p>To display content on your page, you need to create and place blocks on your page.</p>
